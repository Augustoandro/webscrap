# webscrap

It is basic PHP based search engine that provides results that are most similar to the ones entered by the user. The web page can filter results as images, news articles or videos. And also show all of them at the same time.
The system comes with a polite PHP crawler that crawls the web and indexes the links and websites into its database. An admin panel is used start or stop the operation of the crawler. Another PHP script runs in the background, making sure that the links indexed by the crawler havenâ€™t turned into dead ones because of the site moving to a new address or closing down. This ensures that the results provided by the search engine are working links.
